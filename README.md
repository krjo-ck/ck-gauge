## Introduction

This is a Kvaser CanKing extension showing CAN signal values in a gauge chart.

This project shows how to create a simple extension. It is using the SelectSignalDialog for selecting a signal from DBC files and a Material-UI Gauge component for showing the data.

It also uses the useSignalData hook to subscribe on signal updates.
